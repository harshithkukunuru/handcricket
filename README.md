# Hand Cricket
This is a game simulating the popular indian game Hand Cricket. This is played with the computer.
The toss decides whether who picks to bat or bowl. 
Once the choice is made, the person who bats starts inputting numbers from 0-6. Any numbers higher than that aren't accepted and the batting will end.
After batsman is out, the positions will switch and the one who was batting will start batting.
The one with the higher score at the end is the winner.
